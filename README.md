# Cursed Crystal

Cursed Crystal is a totally unnecessary library which allows you to program using Emojis.

This means Emoji keywords, Emoji classes, Emoji functions, ...

Imagine, you have this old dusty legacy Crystal code:

```crystal
class Greeter
  def initialize(name = "Dude")
    puts "Hello, #{name}"
  end
end

test_1 = Greeter.new("Somebody")
test_2 = Greeter.new
```

Ugh, boring. Why not spice it up using Cursed Crystal?

```crystal
🧰 🍊

➡️ 🍊, ⭐(😀 = "Dude"),
  🖊️ "Hello, #{😀}"

💖 = ⭐ 🍊, "Somebody"
🐕 = ⭐ 🍊
```

Much better!

(Please don't ever use this seriously)
